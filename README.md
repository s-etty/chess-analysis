# Chess Analysis

This project is used to analyze my chess games from [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com). The goal of this project is to understand when I make blunders and mistakes, which blunders and mistakes I'm making, and, hopefully, improve my chess game.

## Skills Used

- Pandas
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- API Calls
