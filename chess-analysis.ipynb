    "# Chess Analysis with Stockfish\n",

    "I play way too much chess, but honestly, I'm terrible. Thinking about the games I've played recently, I would say I do pretty well up until somewhere around the tenth move, then things start to break down. But can I can get a better sense of when I begin to fall apart? Would I be a better player if I could keep it together longer?\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "If I am able to make my first blunder or mistake later in the game, I can become a better chess player. In theory, if my opponent makes the first mistake and I'm able to capatilize on it, then I should win.\n",
