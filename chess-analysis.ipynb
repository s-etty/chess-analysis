    "# Chess Analysis with Stockfish\n",
    "\n",
    "I play way too much chess, but honestly, I'm terrible. Thinking about the games I've played recently, I would say I do pretty well up until somewhere around the tenth move, then things start to break down. But can I can get a better sense of when I begin to fall apart? Would I be a better player if I could keep it together longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "If I am able to make my first blunder or mistake later in the game, I can become a better chess player. In theory, if my opponent makes the first mistake and I'm able to capatilize on it, then I should win.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) is an open source chess engine that can recommend the best moves, identify mistakes, and more. I'll be using this engine to analyze all of the games on my [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) profile\n",

    "Ok now that we have the data loaded, let's start to run the Stockfish chess engine on games, move by move. This process takes a lot of processing power, so be patient while it analyzes every move. It took about 15 minutes to process 50 games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chess engine will output an analysis of the board in a unit know as [centipawns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/centipawn#:~:text=Noun,calculation%20purposes%20in%20computer%20chess). A centipawn represents the value of a single pawn. In other words, if you are up 100 centipawns, you are up a single pawn (though it's more complicated than that).\n",
