    "# Chess Analysis with Stockfish\n",
    "\n",
    "I play way too much chess, but honestly, I'm terrible. Thinking about the games I've played recently, I would say I do pretty well up until somewhere around the tenth move, then things start to break down. But can I can get a better sense of when I begin to fall apart? Would I be a better player if I could keep it together longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "If I am able to make my first blunder or mistake later in the game, I can become a better chess player. In theory, if my opponent makes the first mistake and I'm able to capatilize on it, then I should win.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) is an open source chess engine that can recommend the best moves, identify mistakes, and more. I'll be using this engine to analyze all of the games on my [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) profile\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will load games in Portable Game Notation (PGN) from Chess.com. Change the value of the variable user to analyze a different person.\n"
